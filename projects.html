            <td><div class="description">My first legitimate project with JavaScript, I decided to make a drawing program, as I saw the ability to do so with the skills I learned even before our first assignment in class. It is only a rudimentary drawing program, more for sketches, but it is functional. It features a small selection of colors, a stroke width slider, and an “erase all” option by pressing the spacebar.</div></td>

            <td><div class="description">Another project that I actually ended up using as a final programming project for a class, is a small, arcade style game that I like to call “Zombie Shoot ‘Em Up.” This game features zombies that make their way (at random speeds) towards the bottom of the screen, where the mouse guides a pistol to shoot at them. The object of the game is simple: don’t let the zombies reach the bottom!</div></td>

            <td><div class="description">A JavaScript project for my programming class was to create a field to input address information, and an area that outputs the information when “submit” is pressed. It features name, address, city, state, and zip code text inputs, and pushes them out in the correct mailing format on the bottom. There is also an option to print the screen should that be necessary, and a message pop-up after that task has been done.</div></td>

            <td><div class="description">A side project of mine, I used JavaScript to make a button that, when clicked, changes to the face of the beloved Creeper from Minecraft, and, in the console, print out the lyrics to the song “Revenge” by TryHardNinja, a parody of Usher’s “DJ’s Got Us Fallin’ In Love” which was a popular meme for a while. I decided to make this project to try out things I had been learning in class to test my knowledge in how to use them.</div></td>
