        <h2>Who am I exactly?</h2>
        
        <p>
            I am a student at Kansas State Polytechnic University in Salina studying Computer Systems Technology. This webpage is actually an assignment of mine. I thought I'd just put a couple things about me on here. Let's begin then!
        </p>
    
        <h3>I've Got the Formalities, What Kind of Person Are You?</h3>
        <p>
           Well, you know I made this website and am studying computers, so you have probably picked up that I am a bit of a nerd. I enjoy playing computer games as well as board/card games such as Dungeons and Dragons (of which I actually assist in producing a Podcast) and Magic: The Gathering. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>So You Work With Computers? What Have You Done?</h3>
        <p>
           To this day I have already designed a website using HTML5/CSS for my podcast (mentioned above), created a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/michaeldm/present/PQQ0NXJdD" target="_blank">game using JavaScript</a>, and worked a little bit with Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Currently, I am in the process of improving my skills with those and learning Python and C.
